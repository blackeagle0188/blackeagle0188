I'm a full-stack web and blockchain developer.

Enthusiastic and creative Web | Mobile | Blockchain Developer with diverse knowledge in this field. I like to build amazing and interesting things that matter. Have years of hands-on experience efficiently coding websites and mobile applications using modern Javascript, Typescript, Python, PHP, Ruby frameworks, and beautiful UI frameworks. Over the last 2 years, I mainly focused on Blockchain technologies - developing Front-end with Web3 / ether.js/Polkadot/Solidity, Token and Coin development. 

I am available for:
- Smart contract development, testing, and deployment
- Creating web-based front ends to interact with smart contracts
- Creating Cryptocurrencies and launching ICOs

Have a look at my technology stack:

Backend: Node.js, Laravel, Django, .NET, Golang

Mobile App: React Native, Ionic, Swift, Android Java

Blockchains: Ethereum (Solidity, Web3, Truffle, ERC20, ICO), Tron (TRX, TRC10, TRC20 Dapps), Binance Chain

Databases: MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL

DevOps: AWS EC2, SES, S3, CloudFront, Linux, PM2

If we were to get started, here’s how I would approach this project:
1.	Chat with you to determine pain points and essential processes.
Your invitation over a private chat would be highly appreciated.
2.	Prioritize the above to get as much off your plate as possible as efficiently as possible.
3.	Document all new processes and systems, so that it’s very clear what’s getting done, who’s doing it and on what schedule.
4.	Once we establish the new processes, I would look for ways to optimize this and save you even more money by taking some of the more administrative tasks and delegating them to my team (with your approval, first). Once stable processes are in place, I usually try to save my client’s money by assigning some ongoing management to my team, who operate at a lower rate, to save you money.
5.	Over time, we’ll continue to try to find ways to make your project easier and improve.
